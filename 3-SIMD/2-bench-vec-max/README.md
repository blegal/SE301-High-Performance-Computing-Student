## SIMD experiments

### Stage 2 - Let's try with a more complex example ;-)

In this second example, you will write a SIMD function that extracts the maximum value from an array containing float data. To describe this processing in SIMD, you are encouraged to use the example discussed in the previous question.

1 - Open the file that contains the calculation functions (src/vmax/???/???/vec_max_???.cpp) and complete the simd_vec_max function.

1 - Compile the program (main)

2 - Run the program from the terminal to validate the behavior of your function.

3 - Analyze the results obtained.

Once these tasks are done, go to the next part.
